Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Information disclosure, often referred to as "information leakage," occurs when sensitive data is exposed to 
unauthorized individuals or systems. This vulnerability arises due to inadequate access controls, lack of data encryption, 
or software flaws that allow attackers to access confidential information. The secure version prevents this vulnerability 
by implementing strict access control measures, encrypting data both in transit and at rest, and regularly auditing the system
 for potential vulnerabilities. Additionally, employing data masking and minimizing the amount of sensitive information stored 
 can reduce the risk of unauthorized access.


Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Information disclosure primarily violates the Confidentiality aspect of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad.
 Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized parties, and when information disclosure 
 occurs, this principle is breached, leading to potential privacy and security issues.

 
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
To prevent information disclosure, additional security mechanisms that can be incorporated include:
Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools: These tools monitor, detect, and block sensitive data from being shared, stored, or transferred outside the organizationâ€™s network improperly.
Regular Security Audits and Vulnerability Assessments: Conducting regular checks to identify and rectify potential vulnerabilities in the system can prevent information leaks.
Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC): Implementing security best practices throughout the development process can minimize vulnerabilities in the software that could lead to information disclosure.
User Training and Awareness Programs: Educating employees about the importance of data security and the potential risks of information disclosure can reduce the chances of accidental leaks.
