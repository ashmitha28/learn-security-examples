Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Privilege escalation occurs when a user or process gains unauthorized access to resources or capabilities 
that are normally restricted. This vulnerability can arise due to software flaws, misconfigurations, or
insufficient access controls, allowing attackers to elevate their privileges and perform actions beyond their 
regular permissions. The secure version prevents this vulnerability by enforcing the principle of least privilege, 
regularly updating and patching systems, and monitoring for unusual activities that could indicate attempts at privilege 
escalation. Implementing role-based access controls (RBAC) and ensuring that users and processes operate with the minimum 
level of rights necessary for their tasks are key strategies to mitigate this risk.


What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

To prevent privilege escalation attacks, additional security mechanisms that can be incorporated include:
Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Requires users to verify their identity using two or more authentication methods before granting access, adding an extra layer of security.
Regular system and application patching: Keeping software up to date with the latest patches can fix vulnerabilities that might be exploited for privilege escalation.
Audit logs and monitoring: Keeping detailed logs and actively monitoring for suspicious activities can help detect and respond to privilege escalation attempts promptly.
Separation of duties: Dividing critical functions among different users or teams to reduce the risk of a single point of compromise.
Security training and awareness: Educating employees about the risks and indicators of privilege escalation can help prevent successful attacks.
