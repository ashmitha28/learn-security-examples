- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
Repudiation refers to the denial by a user of having performed a specific action in a system, which can be problematic when 
there is no way to prove otherwise. Insecure systems may lack the necessary audit trails and logging mechanisms to track user
 actions accurately. This lack of accountability can lead to security breaches going undetected or unresolved.
  The secure version is better at preventing repudiation by implementing comprehensive logging and monitoring, 
  digital signatures, and non-repudiation services. These mechanisms ensure that actions taken within the system can be 
  attributed to the individual users, making it difficult for them to deny their activities.


What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

To prevent repudiation attacks, additional security mechanisms that can be incorporated include:
Digital Signatures: Ensure the authenticity and integrity of communications, making it possible to verify that a message or document has not been altered and actually comes from the purported sender.
Audit Trails: Detailed logs of all user activities can help trace actions back to the responsible parties.
Non-Repudiation Services: These services, including the use of certificates and timestamps, can provide proof of the origin and integrity of data, making it possible to prove the occurrence of a transaction or event.
Access Controls: Limiting user access to systems and data to only what is necessary for their role can reduce the risk of unauthorized actions being taken.
