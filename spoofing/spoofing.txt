Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Spoofing is a type of cyber attack where the attacker disguises themselves as a trusted source to gain unauthorized 
access to a system, steal data, or spread malware. This vulnerability exploits the trust relationship between the user 
and the system. Spoofing can occur in various forms, including IP address spoofing, email spoofing, and website spoofing. 
The secure version, which includes authentication mechanisms like two-factor authentication (2FA), digital signatures, and 
certificate authorities, helps prevent spoofing by verifying the identity of the entities involved in the communication, 
thereby ensuring that the source is genuine and not impersonated.

Which CIA properties do you think Spoofing violates?

Spoofing primarily violates two properties of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) 
triad:
    Integrity: By impersonating a trusted source, attackers can manipulate data or spread false information, thereby compromising the integrity of the information.
    Authenticity (often considered under Integrity or as a separate element in an extended CIA triad): Spoofing attacks directly target the authenticity of a user or system, as they involve forging the identity of a legitimate source.
