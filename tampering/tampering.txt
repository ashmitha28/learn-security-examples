Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Tampering refers to the unauthorized modification of products, information, or systems. 
In the context of cybersecurity, it involves altering data, code, or configurations to disrupt services, 
steal information, or cause harm. The vulnerability lies in insufficient security controls that fail to detect 
or prevent unauthorized changes. The secure version prevents tampering by implementing strict access controls, 
integrity checks, and auditing mechanisms. For example, using cryptographic hash functions to verify the integrity 
of data and employing file integrity monitoring can detect and prevent unauthorized modifications.


Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Tampering primarily violates the Integrity aspect of the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) triad. 
Integrity ensures that information remains accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. When data, software, or configurations 
are tampered with, their integrity is compromised, leading to potential misinformation, system malfunctions, or security breaches.
